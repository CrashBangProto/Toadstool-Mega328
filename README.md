#Toadstool-Mega328

**Toadstool Development Board - ATmega328P**

The Toadstool family is made up of breadboard-friendly prototyping boards that house a microcontroller, and modules called *Caps* that connect using a standard header.  The prototyping board is analagous to an Arduino/Launchpad and the Cap analagous to a shield/boosterpack.

This repository contains the schematics for the **Toadstool-Mega328** prototyping board, a breadboard-friendly PCB that houses the ATmega328P microcontroller (or other Atmel pin-compatible variants such as the ATmega8/48/88/168/328).

The boards were layed out using [KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org) - KiCad is open source and awesome.

There are a number of other CrashBangProto respositories containing the schematics for other Toadstool boards and Caps, as well as sample code to get you up and running.

Visit the [Toadstool Webpages](http://www.crash-bang.com/projects/toadstool/) for more information on the project.
